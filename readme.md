##### The buggy-script.js accepts two arguments The first argument is the path to a text file, we'll call this source. The second argument is the name of a target directory, we'll call this target. The source file should be a file with the .txt extension The file contains multiple lines of text For each line, the first word is a filename to create inside the target dir. The remaining words on the line are the contents of the file being created. Iterate over each line in the source file to create a new file in the target dir. Here are examples of running the script  node buggy-script.js ./project-outline.txt ./my-project node buggy-script.js ~/Downloads/textfile.txt foo-folder And here's an example for the contents of the source textfile argument:  .gitignore node_modules README.md Welcome to my project! .env NODE_ENV=development index.js console.log('Hello, world!');

## The bug!
### The bug in this script concerns the contents of one of the files it creates.

##### When the source.txt contains a line like this: README.md Welcome to my project! We expect a README.md file to be created with the content: Welcome to my project! The correct README.md is created inside the target argument directory, but the content is wrong The content becomes Welcome,to,my,project!... All of the spaces have been replaced with commas! You need to fix the script so that it doesn't replace the spaces with commas when creating the files.
